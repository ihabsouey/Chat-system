# Chat System Application

This is a simple chat system project consisting of a back-end RESTful API built with FastAPI and a front-end user interface using React. The system allows a user to chat with an agent, providing an interactive experience with basic validations and dynamic responses.

---

## Features

- **Front-End**: Interactive chat interface built with React and the `react-chat-widget`.
- **Back-End**: RESTful API created with FastAPI for handling user messages and providing agent responses.
- **Chat Validation**: Ensures valid chat history (alternating "user" and "agent" messages).
- **Personalized Responses**: The agent's replies are dynamic and slightly personalized.
- **Modern UI Design**: A clean, minimalist design with a gradient background.
